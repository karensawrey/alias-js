# ALIAS-js

Welcome to **ALIAS-js** â€” JavaScript implementation of the decentralized, open, free **alias** protocol for GDPR-based data portability between services.  

**alias** is GDPR-centric decentralized protocol for implementing data portability between
services. It is a part of the GDPR-centered data portability open source developer toolkit [GDPR.dev](https://gdpr.dev/).

Using **alias** protocol, you allow the users to choose their own "data bank" (authorization server) for storing their personal data dumps (defined by GDPR, CCPA, HIIPAA, or any other data privacy regulation). This means that all the data they share with various online services can be securely stored in one place, without the need to duplicate or fully surrender the data to one single social network or other website. 

Third party services that implement an **alias** client can request and receive the user's data by adding a "Login with Alias" button to their website. This is very similar to adding ["Sign in with Facebook" (Facebook Login)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web) or ["Log in with Google" (Google Sign-In)](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) login integrations, but with "Login with Alias", third party services request the data that is stored in a place controlled by a user.


**ALIAS-js** allows automating GDPR-regulated data portability using:

- Email automation templates to request GDPR data portability
- REST APIs to request data from GDPR "dumps"/takeouts
- SDKs to set up decentralized Authorization servers
- GDPR JWT tokens (by including machine-readable GDPR agreements)
- GDPR portability agreement generator that allows developers to request portability data from users in a compliant, machine-readable way

Try **ALIAS-js** to give your users the control over their personal data permissions.
