Dear Madam, dear Sir,


In accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), I wish to exercise my right to data portability to your organization, to all entities within your group of companies or establishments and to all entities under your control.


Please send me, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, all personal data concerning me that I have provided to you or your processors or that I have provided to your co-responsible controllers, collected with my consent or under contract and processed by automated means.


In particular (and without this list being exhaustive) I request a copy of all the following data that I have actively or passively provided (including those in the "notepads" or "comments" fields):

- the data relating to my identification;

- data relating to my personal life;

- data relating to my professional life;

- economic and financial data;

- connection, browsing and location data (including IP address, logs, location data, browsing history including date and time, history of clicked links after each request, cookies, page response times, download errors, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks and mouse hovers) etc.);

- sensitive data, falling within special categories or of a highly personal nature (including the social security number);

data relating to any products, services or contracts that I may have subscribed to (copies of contracts, contents that I may have produced in this context, invoices, etc.).


**Please offer me a format adapted to the type of data concerned, giving priority to open and interoperable formats and please combine the data with appropriate metadata in accordance with the EDPS guidelines.**

**Please note that I wish all this data directly transferred and uploaded to the following server [data controller] https://www.putherethelinkofthetargetserver.com/uploadEndpoint. I do not wish to use myself any download service that you offer to users to download their data themselves**  As you know, the EDPD guidelines on the right to data portability
state: “the new right to data portability aims to empower data subjects regarding their own personal data, as it facilitates their ability to move, copy or transmit personal data easily from one IT environment to another (whether to their own systems, the systems of trusted third parties or those of new data controllers)” and “this  element 
of  data  portability  provides  the  ability  for  data  subjects  not just  to obtain and reuse, but also to transmit the data they have provided to another service provider (either  within  the  same business  sector or in  a  different one)”.

If your group has decided to appoint several Data Protection Officers, please forward this request to the other Data Protection Officers in your group.

As a precaution, I would like to remind you that you have a maximum of one month following receipt of this letter to respond to my request.

Please note that you can contact me by email to the following address youruseremailaddress@domain.com should you need any further information regarding my request.
